On hindsight, the problem of sorting seems to be a no brainer. You're given a list of numbers and all you have to do is sort them in ascending or descending order. We've been doing this since we were wee little kids. 

Let's see how we solve such a sorting problem. Here's the list of numbers we're going to work with:

$$ 4, 7, 2, 3, 5 $$

The sorted list is:

$$ 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 $$

How did we manage to do that? Let's analyze our thought process. The first thing to note is that as human beings who've been taught Math, we know what is a big number and what is a small number. The next thing is FOV (Field of Vision) of our eyes. At a single glance we're able to look at the entire list of 5 numbers. 

Merge the two points and we arrive at our solution in absolutely no time.

Now let's try that again for some practice. Here's a new list : 

$$ 3, 7, 34, 12, 67, 1, 7, 78, 12, 56, 23, 123, 67, 69, 34, 56, 13, 90, 45, 46, 64, 111, 90 $$

Not that easy now, eh?
